# DSCI403-Weather-Prediction

### This project explore Random Forest Regressors for predicting the weather, specifically the temperature.

#### 1.Set up a Random Forest using the training historical weather data and assess its performance on the historical weather test data.

#### 2.Employed a Python display library for Tree Visualization and generated plots illustrating the importance of the learned features.

#### 3.Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather, parsed the response into JSON format to obtain the current weather details, and subsequently compared the current temperature with the predicted value.

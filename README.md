# DSCI403-Weather-Prediction

### This project explored the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict the weather, specifically the temperature.

#### 1.Set up a Random Forest using the training data of historical weather and assessing its performance on the test data.
#### 2.Employed a Python display library for Tree Visualization and generated plots illustrating the importance of the learned features.
#### 3.Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather, parsed the response into JSON format to obtain the current weather details, and subsequently compared the current temperature with the predicted value.

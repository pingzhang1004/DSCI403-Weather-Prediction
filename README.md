# DSCI403-Weather-Prediction
###### * Using Python programming language
###### * I'd be happy to provide source code for interviews!
###### * The course project code is not allowed to be published onlineï¼Œbut I am happy to share the ideas of implementation and running results of my algorithm!

### This project explored the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to predict the weather, specifically the temperature.

#### 1.Set up a Random Forest using the training data of historical weather and assessing its performance on the test data.
#### 2.Employed a Python display library for Tree Visualization and generated plots illustrating the importance of the learned features.
#### 3.Utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather, parsed the response into JSON format to obtain the current weather details, and subsequently compared the current temperature with the predicted value.
